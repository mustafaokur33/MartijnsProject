Can you write an Ansible playbook that:

- reads attached files from a defined directory (ansible find task)
- loops trough the security rules list of attached files
- if the sourceAddressPrefixes list of a security rule contains more than 100 items, replace it with variable asml_summarized_routes (see below)
-write the result to a new file


asml_summarized_routes:
-	10.0.0.0/8
192.168.0.0/16
172.16.0.0/12
146.106.0.0/16
194.105.120.0/21
194.156.12.0/22
